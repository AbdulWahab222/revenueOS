2️⃣ Frontend Page Layout (Next.js + OnchainKit)

Goal: Minimal, fast, clear creator flow + buyer flow.

A) Creator Dashboard

Page: /dashboard

Components:

Wallet Connect (OnchainKit)

Create Paid Link Form

Title: text input

Description: optional textarea

Price: number input (USDC)

Content URL / IPFS hash: text input

Publish Button → calls createLink() on smart contract

Your Links Table

Columns: Link ID | Title | Price | Sold | Copy Link Button

Earnings Summary

Total earned

Withdraw funds button

UX Flow:

Connect wallet → see dashboard

Create new link → appears immediately in table

Copy link → share with audience

B) Public Paid Link Page (Buyer Flow)

Page: /l/[linkId]

Components:

Title & Description

Price Display

Connect Wallet Button

Pay Button

Calls buyLink() on contract

Once paid, unlocks content

Content Reveal Section

Hidden until purchase

Shows URL or download button

UX Flow:

Visitor clicks link → sees title, price

Connects wallet

Pays USDC

Instantly sees content

C) Optional Minimal Styling

Minimal colors → Base theme / Coinbase blue

Mobile-first layout → all creators post links from mobile

Clean typography → trust + ease

Why minimal works:
Focus on proof-of-revenue, not fancy UI. Remember, your MVP goal: get first 5 creators to earn $100 each.
