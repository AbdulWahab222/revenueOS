Perfect. 🔥
We’re building a **real MVP**, not a fantasy startup.

Goal:

> Help 1 crypto-native creator earn their first $100 on Base using your OS.

That’s it.

No dashboards.
No AI.
No complexity.

# 🎯 MVP STRATEGY

Instead of building full “Revenue OS”…

We build:

## 🥇 ONE CORE FEATURE:

### 👉 Paid Link Unlock (USDC on Base)

Because:

* Solves real pain
* Simple technically
* Instant revenue
* Works for all target users
* Reusable contract
* Easy to explain

Everything else can come later.

---

# 🚀 The Exact MVP Feature List (Minimal but Powerful)

## 1️⃣ Creator Login (Wallet Only)

**What it must do:**

* Connect wallet (Base compatible)
* Detect wallet address
* That’s it

No email.
No profiles.
No username system.

Wallet = identity.

---

## 2️⃣ Create Paid Link

Form with ONLY:

* Title (text input)
* Description (optional)
* Price (USDC amount)
* Secret Content (private URL or text)
* Publish button

That’s all.

When creator clicks Publish:

* Smart contract stores:

  * Creator address
  * Price
  * Content hash / ID
* Platform fee auto-defined (e.g., 5%)

No advanced settings.

---

## 3️⃣ Smart Contract (Very Simple Structure)

Must support:

* Accept USDC (on Base)
* Store link ID
* Store price
* Track who paid
* Split revenue:

  * 95% creator
  * 5% you
* Emit Payment Event

No subscriptions.
No NFT gating.
No randomness.
No admin panel.

Simple = reliable.

---

## 4️⃣ Public Payment Page

Each paid link generates:

`yourapp.xyz/l/123`

Page shows:

* Title
* Description
* Price
* Connect wallet button
* Pay button

Flow:

1. User connects wallet
2. Pays USDC
3. Contract verifies payment
4. Unlock content instantly

---

## 5️⃣ Unlock Logic

After payment:

* Show secret content
  OR
* Reveal hidden URL
  OR
* Display download button

Access check:

* Has this wallet paid for this ID?

That’s it.

---

## 6️⃣ Creator Basic Earnings View

Inside dashboard show ONLY:

* Total earned (USDC)
* Number of purchases
* Withdraw button (if needed)

No graphs.
No analytics.
No complexity.

---

# 🧱 What We DO NOT Build

❌ No subscriptions
❌ No raffles
❌ No NFTs
❌ No AI suggestions
❌ No email notifications
❌ No social login
❌ No multi-chain
❌ No complex UI

MVP must feel like:
“Stripe for onchain links.”

---

# 💰 Why This MVP Works

It supports:

Crypto Twitter Creator → Sell $2 alpha thread
AI Prompt Seller → Sell $5 prompt
Alpha Group Admin → Sell one-time access
NFT Founder → Sell special doc

One tool.
Multiple use cases.

---

# 🎯 The Psychological Win

When creator:

* Creates link in 60 seconds
* Posts it
* Gets first USDC payment

That’s your product-market proof.

Not features.

Proof.

---

# 📦 Technical Stack (Simple)

Frontend:
Next.js + OnchainKit

Smart Contract:
Single Solidity contract:

* createLink()
* payForLink()
* hasAccess()
* withdraw()

Token:
USDC on Base

Indexing:
Basic event reading

No backend required for MVP.

---

# ⏳ Realistic Build Time

If focused:

Smart contract: 3–5 days
Frontend MVP: 7–10 days
Testing + polish: 5 days

≈ 3 weeks total.

---

# 🔥 Success Criteria

MVP is successful if:

1. 5 creators use it
2. 1 creator earns $100+
3. You take your %
4. People ask for more features

Only then expand.

---

# 🚀 Expansion Path (After MVP Proves Itself)

Add:

* NFT gating
* Subscriptions
* Raffles
* Analytics
* Creator profiles
* Revenue suggestions

But not before proof.

---

# 🧠 Final Advice

Your goal is not:

“Build a platform.”

Your goal is:

“Help 10 creators make $100 each on Base.”

That’s $1,000 revenue flowing through your contract.

That’s validation.

Now next move:

Do you want me to:

A) Design the exact smart contract structure (clean + reusable)
B) Design the frontend page layout
C) Write the step-by-step 30-day execution plan
D) Design pricing & fee strategy

Pick one and we execute. 🚀
